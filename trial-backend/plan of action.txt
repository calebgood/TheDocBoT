so..here's the plan

user-chatbot interface frontend

1.the bot asks the user to give the description about the symtomn
   eg: I'm getting slightly dizzy, i feel sleepy often, im tired always and there is a rise in my body temperature
something like that..

2. the bot analyses the data and gives a set of options(checkboxes) to pick the symtomns
      eg:tching
	skin rash
	nodal skin eruptions
	continuous sneezing
	shivering
	chills
	joint pain
the user must tick the relavant symtoms

3. The bot based on the input gives the disease name and the related cure and stuff
